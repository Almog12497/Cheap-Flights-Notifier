This app takes information from a Google Sheets'sheet that looks like this:

City | IATA Code | Lowest Price

You need to use the Sheety api to make it work.

To get information for flights I used Kiwi api:

https://partners.kiwi.com/

To send SMS notifications you needs to use Twillo:

https://www.twilio.com/

Create a .env file and fill the appropriate information from these apis.
The app will work after doing so.
